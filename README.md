# SoundSense

SoundSense is an Arduino and ESP8266-based project that leverages MEMS microphone technology for audio processing. This project provides a platform for precise sound detection and analysis, making it versatile for applications such as voice recognition, ambient sound monitoring, and more.

## Features

- MEMS Microphone Integration
- Real-time Audio Processing
- Arduino and ESP8266 Compatibility
- WebSocket Communication
- Simple and Compact Design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE
- PlatformIO 
- ESP8266 Board Support

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/soundsense.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino and ESP8266 board.
4. Connect MEMS microphones and set up your audio processing environment.
5. Install Visual Studio Code and Platform IO extension
6. The project will automatically be initiated


### Usage
